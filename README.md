# FluentDbal
FluentDbal is an easy to use and framework independant fluent database abstraction layer on top of PDO.
It helps you to structure database queries easly without creating overhead.

## Key features
* Allows reusing prepared statements
* Lightweight
* Promotes use of prepared statements, preventing SQL injection hacks

## Starting with FluentDbal
1. Make sure PHP 5.3.* is installed
2. Install FluentDbal using Composer or manually
3. Create a PDO instance
4. Create instance of FluentDbal
5. Use FluentDbal to create queries (sharing PDO connection)

## Example
```php

$pdo = new \PDO('mysql:host=127.0.0.1;dbname=world', '', '');

$dbal = new FluentDbal($pdo);

$query = $dbal
    ->newQuery()
    ->select('city.Name,country.name, city.District')
    ->from('city')
    ->leftJoin('country', 'country.Code = city.CountryCode')
    ->where('city.CountryCode = ?', 'NLD')        
        
    // Orderby can be repeated
    ->orderby('city.Population','DESC')
    ->orderby('city.Name','ASC')
        
    ->limit(1);
    
$city = $query->execute();

print_r($city->fetch());
// stdClass Object
// (
//    [Name] => Amsterdam
//    [name] => Netherlands
//    [District] => Noord-Holland
// )

```

## Changelog
**11-09-2013**: Allow usage of named parameters while building query
For the functions *custom*, *set*, *where* it is now posible to directly add named parameters, to
use this add just one parameter of the type array, with the key as parameter name. If you need to set
multiple parameters add this in the same array. It is NOT posible to mix numbered and named parameters.

Example: ```->where('city.CountryCode = :cc', array(':cc' => 'NLD'))```
